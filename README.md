# Dungeons & Dragons: Who Has the Bigger Spell?



This project visualizes the spellcasting mechanics of D&D, focusing on pure spellcasters (excluding Paladins and Rangers). The visualization features linear graphs that represent the maximum average spell damage per level, showing which dice are rolled and how many.

The data for this visualization was collected from the Russian D&D community website dnd.su, where I manually selected spells based on their average damage values. The calculations for average damage were carefully formulated with the help of ChatGPT, which assisted in developing the logic for the damage calculations and text on poster.

To create the visual representation, I used RawGraphs for initial visualisation and Figma for the final design and layout of the graphs. This project aims to provide a clear, comparative overview of spellcasting progression and the effectiveness of different spells across various levels.
